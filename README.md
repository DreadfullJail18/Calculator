# Simple Calculator Using if-else Statement
## The if-else-if ladder in C allows us to execute the conditional code. The idea is to use a series of if-else statements to check the operator and perform the corresponding operation.

1.Read the two numbers and the operator from the user.

2.Create a result variable to store the result.

3.Create an if-else-if ladder for each of the operator and define the operation inside the corresponding block.

4.Based on the given operator, compute the value of arithmetic operation and store in result

5.Return the result.
